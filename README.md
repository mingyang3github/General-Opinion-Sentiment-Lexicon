## Goal
This general opinion lexicon was proposed by me and my colleagues, which can benefit the reseach of mining specific opinions from texts.

## General Opinions vs Specific Opinions
General opinions in texts are the words, such as good, great, bad. These opinions can express the sentiment of the word. However, they are not very useful for us to understand the reason behind the sentiment.
On the contrary, specific opinions contain both the sentiment information and the reason behind the sentiment. Therefore, mining more specific opinions or separating specific opinions and general opinions is very important. We propose this general opinion lexicon for this purpose.

## Brief Introduction
This lexicon consists of a list of general positive opinons and a list of negative opinions.
The opinions in the lists are manually selected from the opinion lists proposed by Bing Liu. Please find the link below:
