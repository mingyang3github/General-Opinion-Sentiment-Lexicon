## Brief Introduction
This general opinion lexicon was proposed by me and my collegues to benefit the research of mining specific opinions from texts. The effectiveness of this lexicon has been fully proved in our paper (see below). This lexicon consists of **253** general positive opinons and **295** general negative opinions, which are manually selected from the [opinion lists proposed by Bing Liu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html).

## General Opinions vs Specific Opinions
General opinions in texts are the words, such as good, great, bad. These opinions can express the sentiment of the word. However, they are not very useful for us to understand the reason behind the sentiment.
On the contrary, specific opinions contain both the sentiment information and the reason behind the sentiment. Therefore, mining more specific opinions or separating specific opinions and general opinions is very important. We propose this general opinion lexicon for this purpose.
